# cyber-projects
	This is a repository of projects I have worked on related to learning cyber-security!
	The Ansible folder contains the yaml files used by ansible to build the VMs depicted in the network topology diagrams.
	The Diagrams folder contains network topology diagrams - one before the ELK stack build, one after.
	The images folder contains graphics included within the "Prj1-ELK Stack-README" project file.
	The Linux folder contains miscellaneous scripts and other project files from prior units of study. 
	The document "Prj1-ELK Stack-README.md" is the submimssion file required for Project 1.
